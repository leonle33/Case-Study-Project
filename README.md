# Case-Study-Project

This is the capstone project portion for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The purpose of this case study is to showcase the analytical skills I have gained through this certification. In this case study I will go through the steps of the data analysis process, and analyze a dataset from Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. I will use my analysis to identify trends and provide recommendations to improve marketing strategies for Cyclistic. The entire project was completed using the R programming language, leveraging the Kaggle platform for data processing and analysis.

Data Analysis Process
There are six steps that go into the data analysis phase:

* Ask: Defining the business problem and setting clear objectives.
* Prepare: Gathering and cleaning the data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* Process: Transforming the data into a usable format for analysis.
* Analyze: Applying various analytical techniques to identify patterns and trends.
* Share: Communicating the findings through visualizations and reports.
* Act: Providing actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

Each of these steps is meticulously documented and demonstrated in the case study, showcasing my ability to tackle real-world business challenges through data-driven decision-making.
