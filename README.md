# Case-Study-Project

Introduction
This is the capstone project portion for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The purpose of this case study is to showcase the analytical skills I have gained through this certification. In this case study I will go through the steps of the data analysis process, and analyze a dataset from Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. I will use my analysis to identify trends and provide recommendations to improve marketing strategies for Cyclistic.

Data Analysis Process
There are six steps that go into the data analysis phase:

Ask
Prepare
Process
Analyze
Share
Act
In this case study, I will demonstrate each of these steps in order to solve the business task at hand.
